# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is my take on The Odin Project's Etch-A-Sketch assignment. It features a web-based Etch-A-Sketch created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing users with the ability to draw and create colorful patterns on a grid. Users can customize their experience by selecting different grid sizes and colors.
