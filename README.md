This Project is my take on The Odin Project assignment Etch-A-Sketch. 
It consisit of a simple web-based Etch-A-Sketch built with HTML, CSS and JavaScrip, that allows the user to draw and create colorful patterns on a grid. The Users can choose between different grid sizes and colors.

Usage: 
Select a grid size from the options on the left.
Choose a color from the color picker or use a preset color.
Click on a grid cell to color it.
Hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse to draw continuously.
Click the "RESET" button to clear the grid and start over.
